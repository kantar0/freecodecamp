        <h3>His wonderful observations and discoveries</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>On 30 November 1609</strong> - Galileo aimed his telescope at the Moon.  was the first to deduce the cause of the uneven waning as light occlusion from lunar mountains and craters. </li>
        <li><strong>On 7 January 1610</strong> - Galileo observed with his telescope what he described at the time as "three fixed stars, totally invisible, later they will be  Jupiter's moons</li>
        <li><strong>From September 1610</strong> - Galileo observed that Venus exhibits a full set of phases similar to that of the Moon.</li>
        <li><strong>1612 / 1613</strong> - Galileo made naked-eye and telescopic studies of sunspots. Their existence raised another difficulty with the unchanging perfection of the heavens as posited in orthodox Aristotelian celestial physics.  </li>
        
        <li><strong>1617</strong> - Galileo observed the Milky Way, previously believed to be nebulous, and found it to be a multitude of stars packed so densely that they appeared from Earth to be clouds.  </li>
